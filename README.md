## About Me

I'm currently pursuing my MS in CS at Boise State University. My thesis investigates the advantages of application and language-specific string constraint solving for software verification.

I am a dedicated problem-solver with a background in engineering and pre-med. I am passionate about leveraging computer science to develop innovative technical solutions for complex human challenges. My approach is grounded in a multidisciplinary mindset focusing on efficiency and user experience.
